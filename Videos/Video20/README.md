### **Stack Frames - Simple Explanation**
1. **What is a Stack Frame?**
   - A stack frame is created when a function (procedure) is called.
   - It stores local variables, function arguments, and return addresses.

2. **How does the Stack Work?**
   - Each function call creates a new stack frame.
   - Data from previous function calls remains higher up in the stack.
   - The frame is removed when the function finishes executing.

3. **Stack Frame Components:**
   - **Base Pointer (RBP)**: Marks the start of the stack frame.
   - **Stack Pointer (RSP)**: Points to the top of the stack.
   - **Local Variables**: Stored within the stack frame.
   - **Return Address**: Stored to know where to return after execution.

### **GDB Trace for C Code**
We will compile and run your C code in **GDB** to observe stack frames.

#### **Steps to Compile and Debug**
```sh
gcc -g stack_frame.c -o stack_frame
gdb stack_frame
```

#### **GDB Commands**
1. **Set a Breakpoint at `proc`**
   ```sh
   break proc
   ```
2. **Run the Program**
   ```sh
   run
   ```
3. **Print Stack Information**
   ```sh
   info frame
   bt  # Backtrace to see the stack frames
   ```
4. **Step Inside the Function**
   ```sh
   step
   ```
5. **Print Stack Pointer and Base Pointer**
   ```sh
   info registers rsp rbp
   ```
6. **Continue Execution**
   ```sh
   continue
   ```

### **Expected Output in GDB**
```
Breakpoint 1, proc () at stack_frame.c:6
6	    char buffer[1024];

(gdb) info frame
Stack level 0, frame at 0x7fffffffde20:
 rip = 0x55555555516a in proc(); saved rip = 0x55555555517a
 called by frame at 0x7fffffffdf20
 source language c.

(gdb) info registers rsp rbp
rsp            0x7fffffffde20  0x7fffffffde20
rbp            0x7fffffffdf30  0x7fffffffdf30
```
- **`rsp` (Stack Pointer)**: Points to the top of the stack.
- **`rbp` (Base Pointer)**: Used to reference local variables.
- **Return Address**: Saved `RIP` shows where execution will return.

### **NASM Assembly Analysis**
Your NASM program uses `push rbp` and `mov rbp, rsp` to create a stack frame. The `leave` instruction is used to clean up the stack before returning.
